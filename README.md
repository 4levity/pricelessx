Pebble Time watchface/app for a music festival

Post-mortem: There were some little bugs, but it worked really well! I knew what was going on with a glance, and I got reminded to get up and go see favorite artists. Had more artist logos to put in, but the first version allocated them all and used too much RAM - final version fixed this and I could've added a bunch more logos. 

TODO (next year?)
- support original Pebble, maybe other platforms
- store event schedule updates with persistent storage API + companion app (update watch via info booth NFC/wifi kiosk?)
- animations, better layout etc
